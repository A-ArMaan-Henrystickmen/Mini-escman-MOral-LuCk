<p>Braden was drunk driving when he hit the car in the other lane, the passengers in the car got away with minor injuries and a totaled car. A couple years earlier Mrs.Eschemen had also been drunk driving when she, like Braden, hit another car. However, unlike Braden the people in the car she hit sadly passed away.
